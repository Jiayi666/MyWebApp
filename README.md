# MyWebApp

This is a minimum full stack web application purely used for learning and testing. This referred heavily on https://github.com/fastapi/full-stack-fastapi-template

## TODO
1. Create minimum full stack web applications
2. FastAPI for server
3. (maybe?) also FastAPI for WebUI or maybe use React
4. MySQL for database
5. Integrate the application with docker with defined DockerFile
6. Integrate the application with k8s so it supports oneline spin-up and spin-down locally
7. Add stress test benchmark to stress some of the HTTP APIs
8. (for future) integrate with remote k8s like AWS EKS
